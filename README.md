# Background Color Changer 🎨

This is a simple beginner-level JavaScript project that changes the background color of the webpage to a random color each time the button is clicked.

## 🔧 Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (DOM + Events)

## 🚀 How It Works
- A button is placed on the page.
- When the user clicks the button, a random color is generated using JavaScript.
- The background of the webpage updates with the new color.
- The hex code of the current background is also shown on the page.
